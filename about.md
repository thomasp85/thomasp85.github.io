I'm a bioinformatician/computational biologist who focuses on improving researchers interactions with the data they produce. I develop visualizations, frameworks and GUI's as well as related tools (mostly in R). I'm currently employed by [Gubra](http://www.gubra.dk) as a Bioinformatic Researcher/Data Scientist.

I'm on twitter ([@thomasp85](https://twitter.com/thomasp85)) and [GitHub](https://github.com/thomasp85) mainly, though you can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasp85). My posts about R is published on [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) together with a lot of other amazing R related content.

Are you interested in R courses or training - do reach out and we'll see if we can make it work!

There should probably be some more about me here, but it must be added another day...
