Last summer, just prior to starting as an intern working for Hadley, I published
[`fiery`](https://github.com/thomasp85/fiery), a flexible webserver framework
that I had worked on during the spring. The reason why I developed `fiery` amids
offerings such as `shiny`, `opencpu`, and `plumbr` was that I was missing a
back-to-basic server framework with low overhead and freedom to program your
server logic in the way you wanted. For all of their accomplishments I felt that
the other frameworks had different goals.

`fiery` has always been intended to be modular, with support for adding plugins 
in order to augment functionality, but since publishing `fiery` I've 
unfortunately been distracted by other projects (mainly `ggforce`, `ggraph`, 
`tidygraph`, and `particles`). During all this my bad conciusness about the 
`fiery` standstill has nagged my though, and for several different reasons I've 
decided that now is the time to restart development of this ecosystem. This post
is as much a help and incentiviser for me as it is an overview of my plans for 
prospective users.

### routr
The first piece of the puzzle to work on is my 
[`routr`](https://github.com/thomasp85/routr) package which was intented to be
released rather shortly after `fiery` itself but fell down the priority list as
my visualisation packages gained traction. While the main functionality of the 
package is there, it's rough around the edges and is in general need of a full
code review and update. Once `routr` is completed the whole act of writing 
server logic in `fiery` will be much more streamlined and easy.

### A Deployment scheme for fiery apps
`fiery` is both intended for local running apps in the same vien as htmlwidgets
etc., for powering webapp server logic, and for services deployed to production
environment. For the two latter there has yet to come a streamlined deployment 
scheme and this is of course a prerequisit for usage. My current plans, which 
will be developed under the `firestorm` mantle, is to set up infrastructure for
easily deploying `fiery` apps as docker images and leveraging as much as 
possible from the docker ecosystem in terms of setting up load balancing and
service discovery. Optimally all of this should be doable from within R and 
without fiddling with dockerfiles and other configurations.

### Making (some) security easy
The internet is a wild place and you shouldn't expose a sevice without at least
some security measures. While not all of these shld be implemented at the 
`fiery` layer, those that do should be as easy and obvious as possble. The 
`firesafety` plugin package will attempt to collect all the best practices for
secury http(s) and websocket communication with the big wide world

### Taking caree of your data
Whether you're building a stateful app where session should be managed, or a 
REST api, data needs to go somewhere. The `firesale` plugin package will be the
home of a fiery-centric datastore implementation, with support for sessions and
the likes.

### Demos for the demo god
No web framework is complete without example apps, hopefully along with 
easy-to-read guides on how to build them. I hope to be able to provide this as 
well down the line, though focus is of course on providing good R documentation.

## Wrapping up
That was a lot of words and promise without anything to really show for it. I'm
acutely aware of that. The above provides a very loose overview of what I intend
to do, but I'm in no position to provide a timeframe - you can read the list as
sort-of prioritised thus getting a sense of where my spare time will be spend 
first. 

Here's to hoping I don't get derailed again `r emo::ji('smile')`
