Feel free to fork, change, modify and re-use it.

This theme is fully compliant with GH Pages and their dependencies.

## Thanks
Most of the work has been already done by the [Cactus for mac authors](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus/blob/master/AUTHORS), I've just ported their default theme to Jekyll.
I've also added few things specific to Jekyll and some minor style changes.
