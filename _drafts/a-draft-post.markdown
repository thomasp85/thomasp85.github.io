## date: add a date when publishing

Drafts are posts without a date. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet. To get up and running with drafts, check the _drafts folder in the site’s root.

To preview your site with drafts, simply run **`jekyll serve`** or **`jekyll build`** with the **`--drafts`** switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
